# Sentiment_Analysis_Twitter_Data
Demonstrate a short-only algorithmic trading strategy based on the public sentiment on the company based on tweets.

The jupyter notbook contains code to the quantitative analysis report that I published for CityU Investment Club. Check out the report here: https://cityuinvestmentclub.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/curic-quant-report_final.pdf. 

The report tests this strategy on Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google while the code in the jupyter notebook tests it on other companies as well.
